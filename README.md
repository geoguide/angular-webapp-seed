# Modio Admin Portal

This is the administrative interface for modiohealth.

## quickstart

You can get started by doing the following:

    brew install nodejs npm
    npm install -g bower gulp

    npm install # install node dependencies
    bower install # install javascript dependencies
    grunt serve # can also run grunt --environment=staging

Then visit the admin interface in your browser at: http://localhost:9000

*IMPORTANT*: This requires that the API is running on `localhost:3001`.

## important code locations

- Configuration: `config.js` -- *IMPORTANT*: this file is autogenerated based on settings in `Gruntfile.js` (under `Grunt.initConfig`)
- Admin Portal: `app`

## running on prod

To build this on prod, you'll need to run the following:

    grunt build --environment=prod
    cp app/config.js dist

This will output to `dist`.  On the production environment, this should be placed in `<modio-webapp-server>/webapps/admin`.
