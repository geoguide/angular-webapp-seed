# Modio Admin Portal

This is the administrative interface for modiohealth.

## quickstart

You can get started by doing the following:

    gem install --no-ri --no-rdoc compass
    brew install nodejs npm
    npm install -g bower gulp

    npm install # install node dependencies
    bower install # install javascript dependencies
    grunt serve # can also run grunt --environment=qa

Then visit the admin interface in your browser at: http://localhost:9000

*IMPORTANT*: This requires that the API is running on `localhost:3001`.

## configuration

The following environments are available (can be specified with `grunt --environment=<ENV>`)::

- `development`: for local development
- `qa`: for qa development (modiohealth.net)
- `prod_com`: for production dotcom (modiohealth.com)
- `prod_org`: for production dotorg (modiohealth.org)

If you don't specify an environment, it will default to `development`.

## important code locations

- Configuration: `config.js` -- *IMPORTANT*: this file is autogenerated based on settings in `Gruntfile.js` (under `Grunt.initConfig`)
- Admin Portal: `app`

## running on prod

To build this on prod, you'll need to run the following:

    grunt build

This will output to `dist`.  On the production environment, this should be placed in `<modio-webapp-server>/webapps/admin`.
